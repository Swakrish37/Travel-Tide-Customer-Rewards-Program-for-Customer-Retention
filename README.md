Welcome to the Travel Tide Customer Rewards Program for Customer Retention ! In a mission to boost customer retention and add value to our existing customer base,and I embarked on a project to design and execute a personalized rewards program for our travel platform,We recognized the need for an effective rewards program due to poor customer retention, driven by underdeveloped customer experiences. While we successfully built an extensive travel inventory, it was time to optimize and focus on customer loyalty.

**K-Means Clustering**: To enhance personalization, we applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups, allowing for more targeted customization of rewards and perks.

**Optimal Cluster Count**: Using the Elbow Plot and Silhouette Score, we determined the optimal number of clusters to ensure meaningful and effective segmentation.
